# Stylish Seasonal Closet (SSC)
 A project to make Sims 2 clothing more season and style-aware without a lot of manual assignment.

 SSC clothing is well-sorted in the catalog:
 - [CCCASOK](https://lavenderlight.tumblr.com/post/641985485922795520/the-coordinated-closet-create-a-sim-organisation) sorting puts outfits in in the catalog grouped by useful pseudo-expansion-packs that correspond to clothing styles.
- Within each CCCASOK category, clothing is sorted alphabetically by color, using the colors defined by [Color Traits](https://www.tumblr.com/episims/693405410225520640/a-little-something-ive-been-planning-to-do-for-a). (You don't need the color traits to use SSC clothing.)
- Within each color, clothing is sorted into palettes, using palettes defined by Color Palette Traits.
