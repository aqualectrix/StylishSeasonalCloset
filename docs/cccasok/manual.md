# Add Clothing to a CCCASOK Group

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always refer to the reference provided in your [CCCASOK download](https://lavenderlight.tumblr.com/post/641985485922795520/the-coordinated-closet-create-a-sim-organisation) as the final authority in which product IDs correspond to which categories.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you've added the `TheCCCASOK_CAS_Organisation_Kit.package` somewhere in your Downloads folder. This provides the CCCASOK icons. Without it, your clothing will still be sorted by CCCASOK group, but you'll be missing the icons.

1. For each Property Set line in your clothing package (usually just one per age group):
  1. Double click the Property Set to open it in Plugin View.
  1. Change the "creator" value to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
  1. Change the "product" value to one of the values given in your downloaded CCCASOK reference sheet.
