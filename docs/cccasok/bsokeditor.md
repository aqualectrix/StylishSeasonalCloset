# Add Clothing to a CCCASOK Group using the BSOK Editor

The [BSOK Editor](https://www.picknmixmods.com/Sims2/Notes/BsokEditor/BsokEditor.html#files) supports CCCASOK! If the editor doesn't work for you, you can still assign a group [manually](manual.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you've added the `TheCCCASOK_CAS_Organisation_Kit.package` somewhere in your Downloads folder. This provides the CCCASOK icons. Without it, your clothing will still be sorted by CCCASOK group, but you'll be missing the icons.

> [!NOTE]
> If there's been a recent update to CCCASOK, you should check for updates to the BSOK Editor as well. If there's no corresponding update there, either use the XML file provided in the CCCASOK update or edit `bsok_05cccasok.xml` yourself to include the updates.

1. Open the BSOK Editor and point it to the folder with the files you want to CCCASOK-ize. (Don't worry about what it says in the "Bsok" column.)
1. Select all the files you want to put in a particular group.
1. In the "BSOK Product" dropdown, choose "CASSOK". This will autopopulate the other dropdowns.
1. In the lowest dropdown, choose the CCCASOK group you want your selected files to use.
1. Click "Save".
