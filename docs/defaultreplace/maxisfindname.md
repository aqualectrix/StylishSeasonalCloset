# Find the name of a Maxis outfit

If you don't know an outfit's name, either:
- Turn on Debug Mode in CAS and hover over the outfit to learn the name.
  - (Set boolprop testingCheatsEnabled true, then press Shift+N while in CAS.)
- [Create a simple BodyShop package](/docs/packagecreation/bodyshop.md), selecting the outfit you want to replace. Open the package in SimPE and check the "name" field in the Property Set. (You can then throw the package away.)
- Find the mesh part of the name by browsing the [Sims 2 Default Database](https://sims2defaults.dreamwidth.org/). You'll have to make an informed guess about the name of the particular recolor you care about!
