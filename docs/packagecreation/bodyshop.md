# Creating a Clothing Package in BodyShop

A simple procedure, but sometimes I forget if it's been a while.

1. Open BodyShop.
1. Click "Create Parts".
1. Click "Start New Project".
1. Click "Create Clothing".
1. Browse to find a piece of clothing in the gender, age, and category that you want to work with. Pick a full body, top, or bottom as appropriate. (All of these can be changed if necessary, but picking something close to what you want will mean you have to make fewer changes yourself.) Select it.
1. Click the "Export Selected Textures" button.
1. Choose a fairly distinctive name. (This will help you find your .package file in your Saved Sims folder.) Press the checkbox to accept the name.
1. Enter a tooltip. I like this to be the same as the name I'm going to give the file, since it shows up in CAS and will help me find the file a particular outfit belongs to. You can easily change this in SimPE or with other tools, though, so it's not something you have to get 100% right immediately.
1. Click the "Import to Game" button.
1. Accept the popup that appears. Your file is now located in your Saved Sims folder. It will have a name that consists of eight random numbers and letters, an underscore, and your project name: for example, '5f67b2bf_testexport.package'.
1. Close BodyShop
1. Yoink your package out of the Saved Sims folder and move it into your Downloads folder (or appropriate subfolder), ready to edit further and load for testing.
